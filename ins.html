<li> The game simon continues by lighting up the clicked color and an additional one (2). Now you have to click on both colors in the same order (1)-(2).</li>
<li> Simon continues adding and/or repeating new colors (and sounds) that you must memorize and repeat in the same order, until your memory allows it - and / or until you make a mistake :-(</li>
